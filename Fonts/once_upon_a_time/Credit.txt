Font found at https://www.dafont.com/once-upon-a-time.font

This font did not come with its own readme.

On dafont, this font is noted as "donationware", and the description from the author only states the commercial use requires the purchase of a license. With the info available, I have taken that as imlicitly allowing personal use of this font.
