# Known bugs
- Bandit ravager (and others that just drop money) don't actually drop money
- V6.0.3-beta2 - Under some circumstances when using the framework alongside DroneMod, GoddessRewardsAreGifts, PureWindsTools, RikasCustomRestraints, wearing a restraint (tested with "Iron Cuffs") can cause the ravager to repeatedly tear away your underwear and be unable to ravage you (same symptoms as we had when trying to remove skirts from ItemPelvis)
	- Confirmed not an issue when only running the framework
