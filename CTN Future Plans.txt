- Figure out a good way to change what restraints are added to player during fallback (such as making the slime girl apply slime restraints)
- Instead of only grope damage during fallback, sometimes add restraints to player -- Implimented, but only uses jail restraints; will try to add custom restraints soon
- Impliment the plant ravager and probably other ravagers, using Bogus' ideas as a base

	- DONE IN V006 - I really like the plant ravager idea
- I like the ideas presented here: https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1187386814718279720
- "Borrow" some plans from "PLANS AND DETAILS.txt"
- Bast ravager that turns the player into a catgirl?
- Jail guard ravager that takes the player to a torture dungeon?

	- Check for cross-mod incompat; See known issues; Post: https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1296759755611574303; Mod list: https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1296803426390380564
	- Modifier perks; increase ravager stats, more common ravagers, guarantee restraint after use (maybe only one guaranteed) - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1296897530277134387
	- Lower dodge while pinned - Just need to readjust variables that already exist (RavagerNoDodge) (Setting to 1000 penalty resulted in ~20% chance with ~-9900 evasion and ~-100000% penalty) - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1296897530277134387
	- Option to strip all clothes, but not restraints; almost have this, just split {enemy}.ravage.bypassAll into two additional settings: bypassRestraints and bypassClothes - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1296897530277134387

	- Remove all clothing so there isn't scenarios where you get stripped but there's no visual difference; scenarios fixable via above ('Occupied' restraints with models); example outfits with issues: https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1297893018992644247 - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1297598589555445912
	- (Mouth?) occupation puts character in kneeling pose - None of the in-game poses work well for this idea - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1297205431113875526
	- 'Private Time' status to repel non-ravagers while being ravaged - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1296897530277134387
	- Make sure 'Have fun with me' flirting option triggers ravaging correctly - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1296897530277134387
	- Flirting option to be 'taken home' / jailed to a custom map (another suggestion) where only/mostly ravagers spawn - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1296897632354172968
	- Trap rooms in the custom map that would trap the player in the room with a ravager - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1296898496229544111
	- Drag player to a bed / other furniture trap if available instead of passing out - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1296203259924578405
	- Ravager visits in jail; might be intended already for bandit, but haven't tested; make sure it works and add other non-immobile ravagers - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1295866151695548457
	- Modifier perk to increase restrain chance of ravagers; exclusive with guaranteed perk above? - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1295851910351552532
	- Tentacle Pit rare interaction to engulf the player (like my unreleased tentacle ravager), then continue spawning ravager tendrils to continuously ravage the player until either escape or pass out; would require manually adding the restraint instead of tentacle ravager's method; highly thumb-up'd suggestion, but might feel jank without reworking the pass out mechanic; high priority nonetheless - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1295060266181984256
	- Custom 'ravager-filled' floor to potentially be dragged to instead of passing out; maybe take the method of the SarcoKraken's engulf spell, which allows for some custom narration to happen along the lines of "Let's get you home to your new family~" and allowing the player to attempt an escape - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1295941022076899341
	- In-wall leashing 'cyber tentacles'/wall of tentacles ravager - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1308582085027561605
	- Above, but in furniture - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1308583283507859559
	- Void Patrol Ravager that summons tendrils/something to ravage your while hypnotizing you - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1310026935258185759
	- 'Harem Demon' to summon lesser demons as ravagers to only grope you. Once weakened/'captured', 'harem lord' comes to take advantage - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1310026935258185759

	- Ruined makeup after being ravaged would need a model as some sort of makeup that can't be hidden by blindfolds that cover a smaller area than the makeup - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1316222771453235221
	- Add sound effects to ravaging - use `Object.values(KDAllModFiles).map((mod) => mod.filename).includes('GirlSound.ks')` to check if the current Sound Effect mod is loaded in order to avoid playing multiple sound effects (also check for 'girlsound.ks' to check for death_comsos' old sound effect mod) - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1329505099705487411


Known Issues:
	- V6.0.3-beta1 - Ravager outfits don't show the hair pin until the second time it is viewed
	- V6.0.3-beta2 - Under some circumstances when using the framework alongside DroneMod, GoddessRewardsAreGifts, PureWindsTools, RikasCustomRestraints, wearing a restraint (tested with "Iron Cuffs") can cause the ravager to repeatedly tear away your underwear and be unable to ravage you (same symptoms as we had when trying to remove skirts from ItemPelvis)
		- Confirmed not an issue when only running the framework
