- Figure out a good way to change what restraints are added to player during fallback (such as making the slime girl apply slime restraints)
- Instead of only grope damage during fallback, sometimes add restraints to player -- Implimented, but only uses jail restraints; will try to add custom restraints soon
- Impliment the plant ravager and probably other ravagers, using Bogus' ideas as a base

	- I really like the plant ravager idea
- I like the ideas presented here: https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1187386814718279720
- "Borrow" some plans from "PLANS AND DETAILS.txt"

From community:
	- During V6 dev:
		- 'Occupied' restraints apply skirt lift (like crotch rope) / mouth open (like invis gag) - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1298403509338640450
		- Remove all clothing so there isn't scenarios where you get stripped but there's no visual difference; scenarios fixable via above; example outfits with issues: https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1297893018992644247 - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1297598589555445912

		- Option to strip all clothes, but not restraints; almost have this, just split {enemy}.ravage.bypassAll into two additional settings: bypassRestraints and bypassClothes - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1296897530277134387

		- Drag player to a bed / other furniture trap if available instead of passing out - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1296203259924578405
		- Ravager visits in jail; might be intended already for bandit, but haven't tested; make sure it works and add other non-immobile ravagers - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1295866151695548457

		- Tentacle Pit rare interaction to engulf the player (like my unreleased tentacle ravager), then continue spawning ravager tendrils to continuously ravage the player until either escape or pass out; would require manually adding the restraint instead of tentacle ravager's method; highly thumb-up'd suggestion, but might feel jank without reworking the pass out mechanic; high priority nonetheless - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1295060266181984256
		- Custom 'ravager-filled' floor to potentially be dragged to instead of passing out; maybe take the method of the SarcoKraken's engulf spell, which allows for some custom narration to happen along the lines of "Let's get you home to your new family~" and allowing the player to attempt an escape - https://discord.com/channels/938203644023685181/1183991709768622090/1295941022076899341
